# Radarr

Radarr is a movie collection manager for Usenet and BitTorrent users. It can monitor multiple RSS feeds for new movies
and will interface with clients and indexers to grab, sort, and rename them. It can also be configured to automatically
upgrade the quality of existing files in the library when a better quality format becomes available.

## Docker

This Docker image is using [Ubuntu 22.04](https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu/) as base image. Radarr runs as a user with
the id `1000`.

## How to get hardlinks working

Your directory structure should look like this:
You want to pass /media to the container. If you use two different volumes hardlinks and atomic moves will not work.

```
/media
    /torrents
        (Where your torrent client stores your downloads)
    /tvshows
        (Where Sonarr stores your TV shows)
```
